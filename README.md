## Folder Descriptions:

**core/:** Contains fundamental components like error handling, services, utilities, middleware, and constants that are used across the entire application.

**data/:** Handles data-related tasks, including data sources (e.g., API interactions), models (data representations), and repository implementations that fetch data from various sources.

**domain/:** Encapsulates the business logic, including entities (core data structures), repository interfaces, and use cases (application-specific business rules).

**presentation/:** Manages the UI layer, including bindings (dependency injection for views), controllers (state management), pages (UI screens), widgets (reusable UI components), and utility classes.

**routes/:** Manages application routing using GetX, defining pages and route names.

**injection_container.dart:** Sets up and registers all dependencies using get_it.

**main.dart:** The entry point of the application, initializing dependencies and running the app.
